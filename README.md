# Investigate-Bikeshare-data-using-Python
## Project Description
In this project, i will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
The project creates a software where a user could make analysis choices and based on them, results will be displayed. The software is built using mostly python built-in functions as well as the Pandas and Numpy libraries.
